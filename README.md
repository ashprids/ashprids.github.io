## Information
This website is my personal internet homepage, serving as a frontend for my personal projects and ramblings. The website was made with nothing more than inspiration and a HTML IDE.

All of the website's objects and graphics (apart from images and icons) are made using ASCII characters. If you'd like a guide to make your own ASCII shapes, check out this Wikipedia page:
